event: a specific occurrence, happening, or change in state that takes place at a particular point in space and time. It is the basic unit we use to mark that something has happened, distinguishing a moment of action or significance from the background flow of time. It usually requires four core components.
a boundary which has a discernible beginning and an end, not a permanent state; a change that something is different after the event than it was before; a context that happens to someone or something in a specific location. a time-stamp that it is localized to a specific moment or duration.
