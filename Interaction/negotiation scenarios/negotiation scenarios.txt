negotiation domain: diplomatic and security
negotiation time period: 2008 
negotiation location: Malaysia 
negotiation topic: negotiating a draft autonomy and governance framework in the southern Philippines through the Memorandum of Agreement on Ancestral Domain, and managing the last minute collapse of the planned signing.
negotiation parties: Government of the Philippines negotiating panel, Moro Islamic Liberation Front negotiating panel, Supreme Court of the Philippines as the institution issuing the restraining order and later ruling, Malaysia as the third party facilitator and host 
negotiation result: the planned signing in Kuala Lumpur was stopped by a court restraining order, and the draft agreement was later declared unconstitutional, forcing the parties back to redesign the process and terms.
negotiation strategy: the Government of the Philippines pursued a near ready agreement strategy to lock in momentum and convert talks into a signature event, then shifted to legal and political risk containment when domestic opposition and judicial scrutiny surged, re entering later with stronger emphasis on consultation and constitutionality; the Moro Islamic Liberation Front used a threshold commitment strategy by pushing hard for signature as a decisive milestone, then applied pressure by signaling that delay had consequences while keeping the channel open to preserve long term political gains; the Supreme Court used injunction and judicial review to block an irreversible commitment without required public process and constitutional clarity, thereby redefining what was negotiable and forcing a reset; Malaysia used convening and continuity by hosting and facilitating the talks and sustaining the process after breakdown so the parties still had a workable channel for renewed bargaining.
negotiation description: The negotiating panels of the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front worked toward a draft agreement intended as a decisive step toward a broader settlement, with Malaysia hosting the process in Kuala Lumpur. As the parties moved to formalize the draft through a scheduled signing on August 5, 2008, domestic political leaders and local officials raised objections and challenged the process, arguing that they had not been consulted and questioning the legality of what was being agreed. One day before the signing, the Supreme Court issued a restraining order that blocked the ceremony in Kuala Lumpur, instantly flipping the negotiation from endgame to crisis management and leaving both sides to recalibrate under public scrutiny. The breakdown triggered renewed instability and intensified mistrust, illustrating how a last minute procedural and legitimacy challenge can unravel years of bargaining progress. On October 14, 2008, the Supreme Court later ruled the draft agreement unconstitutional, which foreclosed the original pathway and forced any future deal to be redesigned within constitutional limits and with greater consultation. Malaysia and other facilitators continued to support the process, and the parties were pushed back toward a slower, more politically defensible approach that could survive courts, stakeholders, and implementation constraints rather than relying on a single signature moment to carry the agreement across the finish line.


negotiation domain: partnership and governance
negotiation time period: 2018 
negotiation location: United States 
negotiation topic: negotiating merger control and partnership terms between two similarly sized companies after the counterparty opens with an aggressive take it or leave it approach. 
negotiation parties: Company A negotiating team, the company seeking a balanced merger, supported by a negotiation advisor and including Kurt as a key negotiator who later reframes the discussion; Company B negotiating team, the counterparty company, represented by three negotiators including Oliver as lead negotiator and two colleagues who become the practical channel for agreement after Olivers breakdown. 
negotiation result: after the initial power play collapses, the teams shift into a problem solving mode and reach a workable deal. 
negotiation strategy: Company A uses disciplined preparation and refusal to be rushed, holding to clear walk away limits and declining to accept a forced binary choice, then uses process steering once an opening appears by having Kurt directly reframe the conversation toward joint problem solving and concrete options with Company B’s more reasonable negotiators; Company B’s lead negotiator Oliver uses dominance and intimidation tactics such as controlling the agenda, demanding control, pounding the table, and issuing a take it or leave it ultimatum to force quick capitulation, but after an embarrassing loss of composure he effectively removes himself from the center, while his two colleagues pivot into a face saving reset by engaging with Kurt and allowing the negotiation to proceed on a collaborative track.
negotiation description: Company A prepares for a merger negotiation with the help of a negotiation advisor, expecting a roughly balanced discussion because the two companies are similar in size and stature, and Company A enters with defined targets and limits so it will not concede under pressure. Company B arrives with three negotiators led by Oliver, who immediately takes over the room with a hardline posture, presses for control, and rejects efforts to move toward cooperative problem solving, escalating until he declares the offer take it or leave it and storms toward a door in a dramatic attempt to end the meeting. Oliver mistakenly goes into a walk in closet instead of leaving, and the moment breaks the tension across the room, undermining the credibility of the intimidation play and creating a psychological reset. As Oliver becomes embarrassed and sidelined, Kurt from Company A uses the opening to address Company B’s other two negotiators directly, proposing a different way to proceed and inviting them to explore options rather than ultimatums. The negotiation shifts from dominance and anxiety tactics into a constructive exchange, and the parties are able to work toward an agreement that they could not reach under the original approach. 


negotiation domain: diplomatic and security
negotiation time period: 2015
negotiation location: Austria
negotiation topic: negotiating a nuclear limitations and verification arrangement between Iran and major powers in exchange for phased sanctions relief, culminating in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
negotiation parties: Islamic Republic of Iran negotiating team led by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif representing the Iranian government, United States negotiating team led by Secretary of State John Kerry representing the United States government, United Kingdom negotiating team led by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond representing the United Kingdom government, French Republic negotiating team led by Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius representing the French government, Russian Federation negotiating team led by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov representing the Russian government, People’s Republic of China negotiating team led by Foreign Minister Wang Yi representing the Chinese government, European Union negotiating coordination led by High Representative Federica Mogherini representing the European Union as facilitator and coordinator.
negotiation result: the parties reached a comprehensive agreement that imposed time bound constraints and inspection mechanisms on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for structured sanctions relief and a monitoring framework.
negotiation strategy: Iran used a sanctions relief first strategy by tying meaningful nuclear constraints to concrete and staged economic normalization, while protecting face and sovereignty by insisting on reciprocity and a clearly defined end state; the United States used a verification first strategy by prioritizing intrusive monitoring, detailed technical limits, and phased relief that could be reversed if commitments were breached, while also managing domestic political risk by emphasizing enforcement and compliance triggers; the United Kingdom used coalition alignment and bridging by staying closely coordinated with the United States and European partners, pushing for practical compromise language that preserved unity and reduced last minute fractures; France used a tough line leverage strategy by holding out for stricter technical thresholds and clearer inspection provisions, using credible willingness to delay agreement to extract stronger safeguards; Russia used influence and trade space by supporting an agreement that reduced conflict risk while seeking room for its own diplomatic and economic ties, positioning itself as both stakeholder and alternative channel for Iran; China used stability and incrementalism by supporting a deal that reduced regional escalation risk and favored step by step implementation, reinforcing consensus without becoming the primary blocker; the European Union used process control and package framing by keeping all sides inside a single negotiated text, sequencing decisions, and converting disagreements into drafting issues so momentum stayed intact until a final comprehensive package could be announced.
negotiation description: After years of escalation, sanctions, and intermittent talks, Iran and a group of major powers returned to intensive negotiations aimed at trading nuclear constraints for sanctions relief, with sessions concentrated in Vienna as a workable and secure venue for sustained drafting. Iran sought meaningful economic relief and recognition of its right to a civilian nuclear program, while the major powers focused on extending the time needed for any potential weapons pathway and securing verification strong enough to detect and deter violations. Early progress depended on converting political slogans into measurable technical limits, such as caps on enrichment levels, restrictions on stockpiles, and redesign or limitation of sensitive facilities, alongside an inspection regime that could credibly monitor compliance over time. As bargaining tightened, the hardest disputes clustered around sequencing and reversibility, because Iran wanted early and tangible relief while the United States and partners needed assurance that constraints and inspections would be in place before relief became irreversible, and France pressed for particularly clear language on safeguards. The negotiations repeatedly risked stalling when domestic audiences interpreted concessions as weakness, so the teams used careful drafting, staged implementation, and reciprocal steps to make the package defensible at home while still valuable to the other side. The European Union played a central role in maintaining a single negotiating track, managing the schedule, and shaping a complete package so that partial agreements could not be cherry picked and collapse the whole bargain. The final stretch centered on locking in a unified text that balanced time bound limits, monitoring and access, phased relief, and mechanisms to address noncompliance, allowing each side to claim that its core interests had been protected. In July 2015, the parties concluded the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in Vienna, presenting it as a comprehensive exchange in which nuclear constraints and verification were paired with structured sanctions relief and an ongoing compliance framework, turning a high risk security dispute into an implementable, if politically contested, negotiated arrangement.


negotiation domain: partnership and governance
negotiation time period: 1955 
negotiation location: United States 
negotiation topic: negotiating a high volume purchase deal for transistor radios where the buyer demands the products be sold under the buyer brand rather than the seller brand. 
negotiation parties: Sony represented by Akio Morita as the lead decision maker pushing a brand building strategy for Sony in the US market, Bulova represented by Bulova purchasing and brand executives seeking a large order under the Bulova name. 
negotiation result: Sony declined the lucrative order because accepting would have undermined its long term objective of building the Sony brand in the United States. 
negotiation strategy: Sony used a goal first strategy by treating brand establishment as the top objective and refusing a deal that conflicted with it even though it was financially attractive, relying on the alternative of continuing to sell under the Sony name and pursuing other retail channels; Bulova used conditional leverage by offering an exceptionally large purchase volume but making it contingent on private label branding so Bulova captured the consumer recognition and Sony became an anonymous supplier. 
negotiation description: In 1955, Morita traveled to the United States to introduce Sony’s transistor radios and make the Sony name known in the American market, but early interest was limited.  Bulova then offered to buy a very large quantity, a deal that would have been transformative in short term revenue for a young company with constrained capital.  The offer came with a key condition, Bulova wanted the radios marketed under the Bulova brand name rather than Sony, turning the transaction into a trade off between immediate profit and long term brand equity.  Morita evaluated the proposal against Sony’s primary objective for entering the US market, building Sony into a recognized household name, and concluded that accepting a private label arrangement would move Sony away from that strategic goal even if it solved short term financial needs. ([You Exec][2]) He therefore rejected the order and continued pursuing distribution paths that preserved Sony branding, using the episode as an example of how negotiators should define what success means before bargaining so they do not accept attractive terms that push them away from their real objective. ([You Exec][2])

negotiation time period: 1989
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: Sony Corporation negotiated to acquire Guber-Peters Entertainment Company and secure leadership for Columbia Pictures Entertainment, then had to negotiate a costly settlement to free the executives from an existing studio contract dispute.
negotiation parties: Sony Corporation negotiating side led by its senior executives and deal advisers representing the buyer and new studio owner, Peter Guber and Jon Peters negotiating as the sellers of Guber Peters Entertainment and as incoming studio leaders, Warner Communications negotiating to protect its contractual rights through its studio arm Warner Bros., with background pressure from the studio ownership transition after The Coca-Cola Company agreed to sell control of Columbia Pictures Entertainment.
negotiation result: Sony secured the acquisition and leadership appointments, but only after paying a very large overall package and settlement costs, and the episode became a cautionary example of how deal excitement can lead a buyer to accept value destroying terms.
negotiation strategy: Sony used a speed and certainty strategy by moving fast to lock up marquee leadership and close the transaction with a premium package, then used checkbook settlement strategy to remove legal obstacles by paying to resolve the contract fight rather than risking delay to its studio plan; Guber and Peters used star power leverage and package extraction by linking their willingness to run the studio to rich economics, including acquisition value for their company and high personal compensation, while allowing Sony to tell a strategic control story; Warner used contractual leverage and credible escalation through litigation threat to raise the cost of extracting Guber and Peters from their existing commitments, pushing Sony toward a settlement that made Warner whole and preserved deterrence against poaching.
negotiation description: In 1989, Sony was moving to establish a major presence in Hollywood through control of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and it wanted experienced hitmakers to run the studio immediately to signal momentum and credibility. Sony approached Peter Guber and Jon Peters, who had a high profile from producing successful films, and the discussion quickly became a bundled negotiation where Sony was not only buying a production company but also buying leadership, influence, and a public narrative of strong management. The attractiveness of the package created leverage for Guber and Peters, because Sony saw them as the shortcut to rapid legitimacy in a complex industry. However, a major obstacle surfaced because Warner claimed contractual rights over Guber and Peters, and the dispute escalated into litigation risk that threatened timing and distracted from the studio transition. At that point, the negotiation shifted from a straightforward acquisition and employment package into a three sided problem, Sony needed the executives in place quickly, Guber and Peters needed a path out of restrictions, and Warner wanted compensation and vindication of contract strength. Sony chose to resolve the bottleneck with money rather than delay, negotiating a settlement large enough to remove the injunction risk and end the dispute, while keeping the larger strategic goal intact. With the settlement achieved, Sony completed the acquisition and installed Guber and Peters at the studio, but the size and structure of the overall package later drew criticism as an example of a buyer overpaying and under protecting itself when negotiating under excitement, time pressure, and reputation stakes.


negotiation domain: family and relationship
negotiation time period: 2000s 
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: negotiating how much to contribute to a school softball fundraiser while trading a non monetary favor to justify buying a larger package.
negotiation parties: G. Richard Shell as the household decision maker and buyer deciding whether and how much to purchase, Emily as the neighbor’s teenage fundraiser caller selling citrus fruit packages for her school softball team, Robbie as Shell’s spouse and internal stakeholder who suggests adding a separate household need to the conversation, Ben as Shell’s son and internal stakeholder who highlights the need for a guinea pig sitter.
negotiation result: Shell agrees to buy a larger fundraiser package after Emily agrees to take care of the family’s guinea pig during the upcoming weekend.
negotiation strategy: Shell uses a low-commitment entry strategy by asking for information first and initially choosing the smallest package to limit cost and storage burden, then uses issue expansion and trade by introducing a separate need that the caller can satisfy; Robbie and Ben use leverage creation by identifying a valuable non monetary request that can be bundled into the exchange; Emily uses upsell sequencing by accepting the initial purchase and then, after agreeing to the added favor request, immediately asking for a higher priced package, converting the new goodwill into a larger commitment.
negotiation description: Shell is at the dinner table when a neighbor’s teenage daughter calls to raise money for her school softball team by selling citrus fruit packages at different price points. Wanting to be supportive, he asks her to explain the options and, after hearing the prices, chooses the smallest package because he is unsure where the family would store a larger amount of fruit. At that moment his wife and son point out that the family needs someone to care for their guinea pig over the coming weekend while they are away, so Shell returns to the call and asks Emily whether she can take care of the guinea pig. Emily agrees immediately, and without pausing she follows by asking whether he could instead buy the larger package. With the pet-sitting favor now added to the overall exchange, Shell laughs and agrees to purchase the higher priced package, ending the call with a larger contribution than he originally intended because the negotiation shifted from a simple purchase decision into a bundled trade of money and a helpful service.

negotiation time period:
negotiation location: Tanzania
negotiation topic: negotiating compensation and settlement of a land claim and related retaliatory incidents between two neighboring farmers through elder mediated dispute resolution.
negotiation parties: Farmer A as a claimant to a vacant strip of land between two farms, Farmer A elder representative as spokesperson and negotiator for Farmer A lineage, Farmer A supporters as the group backing Farmer A position; Farmer B as a competing claimant to the same strip of land, Farmer B elder representative as spokesperson and negotiator for Farmer B lineage, Farmer B supporters as the group backing Farmer B position; Arusha community elders as the neutral forum conveners and process managers hosting the negotiation under customary norms.
negotiation result: the elders guide the parties to a successful settlement that resolves the land dispute and compensation demands and ends the immediate cycle of retaliation.
negotiation strategy: Farmer A uses grievance stacking and compensation anchoring by presenting a list of wrongs and demanding restitution while rallying his group to reinforce his position, and uses rights based framing by treating the vacant land as a legitimate claim; Farmer B mirrors the same approach with counterclaims and loud rejection to defend his legitimacy and keep the bargaining space from collapsing into unilateral concession; the elders use ritualized agenda control and structured dialogue by having each side speak formally through representatives, letting exaggerated demands be aired early as part of the process, keeping discussion going for a full day with a shared expectation of eventual convergence, and using customary reconciliation mechanisms such as exchange and face saving closure to convert a heated dispute into a stable agreement.
negotiation description: Two neighboring farmers in an Arusha village come into conflict over a vacant area of land between their farms that had once been held by a family line that died out, and the dispute escalates beyond words into a chain of incidents that includes damage to an irrigation gate and a beating tied to accusations of trespass, prompting a demand for formal settlement. Under a stand of large trees that functions as the community’s negotiation venue, elders representing each farmer’s lineage meet and open the process with formal statements, each side presenting grievances and demanding compensation while each farmer’s group loudly rejects the other side’s demands and adds further arguments. The negotiation proceeds as a long, ritualized exchange in which the parties push the boundaries of what could be acceptable through exaggerated offers and counteroffers, while the elders maintain order, keep the discussion moving, and preserve the expectation that a resolution is reachable if the parties stay in the process. Over the course of the discussions, the elders guide the parties from accusation and posturing toward practical settlement terms that address both the land claim and the compensation issues arising from the retaliation. The process concludes in a reconciliatory manner consistent with local norms, using a closing gesture that allows both sides to save face, acknowledge a workable outcome, and restore social stability between the two households and their supporters.


negotiation domain: employment and work
negotiation time period: 2008 
negotiation location: United States 
negotiation topic: negotiating the compensation and role terms for Sheryl Sandberg to join Facebook as chief operating officer after an initial offer she considered insufficient. 
negotiation parties: Sheryl Sandberg as the candidate negotiating her employment terms, Mark Zuckerberg as the hiring decision maker representing Facebook leadership and approving the offer package. 
negotiation result: Sandberg rejected the initial offer, stated her requirements, and received a significantly improved offer shortly afterward that led to her joining Facebook. 
negotiation strategy: Sandberg used a value-assertion and reframing strategy by refusing to accept the first offer, explicitly anchoring the conversation around what she wanted and why she was worth it, and emphasizing that this was the one moment where she and Zuckerberg were on opposite sides of the table; Zuckerberg used a recalibration strategy by returning quickly with a materially better package after receiving a clear ask, trading speed and improved terms for securing a high-impact hire. 
negotiation description: Facebook made an offer to Sandberg for a senior operating role, but after reflecting on how negotiation behavior should match the responsibilities of running deal teams, she told Zuckerberg she could not accept the initial proposal and laid out what she wanted instead, framing the conversation as a unique one-time negotiation between them before becoming aligned on the same side inside the company.  The next day, Zuckerberg returned with a significantly improved offer, and Sandberg ultimately joined Facebook with her employment governed by an offer letter that was later amended and restated, formalizing duties and terms for her role.

negotiation time period: 1991
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: negotiating the survival and sale of a financially distressed publishing house through an acquisition negotiation between its chief executive and a well-funded corporate buyer.
negotiation parties: Peter Jovanovich as chief executive representing Harcourt Brace Jovanovich and seeking a buyer on terms that preserve value and legacy, Richard A. Smith as chief executive representing General Cinema as the prospective acquirer, legal and financial advisors on both sides supporting valuation, structure, and deal execution.
negotiation result: the opening interaction breaks scripted posturing and moves both sides into sincere, substantive deal talks that ultimately lead to the company being acquired.
negotiation strategy: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich uses signal-and-frame strategy by positioning its leader as an attentive listener to gather information while sending a costly credibility signal at the start, a personalized engraved watch offered as a relationship marker, to reframe the meeting from adversarial bargaining into partnership formation and to invite reciprocal seriousness; General Cinema uses suitor strategy by arriving with a prepared narrative about financial strength and a cautious opening designed to avoid inflating price expectations, then accepts the relationship frame and shifts quickly into problem solving once sincerity is demonstrated; both sides use process reset strategy by abandoning the planned scripts early, lowering defensiveness, and converting emotional uncertainty into momentum through sustained discussion into the night.
negotiation description: In a New York City conference room on a cold January day, two chief executives meet face-to-face to discuss a possible merger or sale, with each side arriving with a carefully prepared script for how the opening should unfold and with advisors nearby expecting a controlled exchange of positions. The buyer’s leader intends to present strength and sympathy while staying guarded on price, and the publishing executive’s team intends for him to listen closely and reveal no urgency even though the company is under severe strain. Seconds into the buyer’s opening, the publishing executive interrupts and places a small box on the table, revealing an engraved watch tied to his father’s tradition of giving such a gift at the beginning of a new business relationship, a move that deliberately breaks the scripted dance and risks showing his real desire to find the right partner. The gesture changes the emotional temperature in the room, reduces tension, and creates a reciprocity cue that this will be handled as a serious relationship decision rather than a cold extraction. With the scripts effectively discarded, the two leaders and their teams begin talking candidly about how a deal could be done, moving from posture to substance and continuing late into the night, establishing the negotiating foundation that carries the process forward into a successful acquisition outcome.


negotiation domain: employement and work
negotiation time period: late 1980s 
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: negotiating a pay raise and retention decision for a star television host when his agent attempts to use outside offers to force the network owner to match.
negotiation parties: Larry King as the employee and on air talent deciding whether to stay, Larry King agent as the representative seeking competing offers and a higher salary, Ted Turner as the owner decision maker for CNN and the employer side, CNN management as the organizational employer channel through which compensation decisions are implemented.
negotiation result: Larry King stays at CNN and receives only a modest raise, and the agent’s leverage play collapses because the owner secures the outcome through a direct relational appeal to the principal.
negotiation strategy: the agent uses competitive bidding leverage by shopping Larry King to other networks to create outside options and then threatening Larry King departure unless the employer matches, aiming to force a large raise through fear of loss; Ted Turner uses bypass and relationship leverage by going directly to Larry King rather than bargaining through the agent, anchoring on loyalty and personal connection instead of price, and turning the negotiation into a commitment conversation rather than a bidding war; Larry King uses preference revelation and selective acceptance by choosing the relationship and stability he values over maximizing salary, accepting a smaller raise while keeping decision authority in his own hands.
negotiation description: Larry King’s agent tries to increase Larry King’s compensation by approaching other television networks and collecting attractive outside offers, then returns to CNN’s owner Ted Turner with the implied threat that Larry King could move unless CNN pays a much higher amount. Turner refuses to be pulled into the bidding dynamic and does not respond by matching the large offers through the agent channel. Instead, with the agent present, Turner calls Larry King directly and speaks in a personal, relationship-centered way, telling him to stay with him. Larry King answers simply that he will stay, effectively ending the leverage created by outside offers because the principal commits without demanding the agent’s targeted price. The agent is left surprised because the expected economic showdown turns into a direct commitment choice, and Turner follows with only a modest raise, achieving retention while avoiding the costly escalation the agent tried to trigger.


negotiation domain: partnership and governance
negotiation time period: 1986 
negotiation location: United States 
negotiation topic: negotiating financing terms for Staples after early backers demanded overly aggressive terms, by resetting the negotiation to better aligned capital providers and moving fast to close funding. 
negotiation parties: Thomas Stemberg as founder negotiating financing for Staples, initial venture capital backers as current funders demanding a larger share and tougher terms, Martin Trust as prospective investor offering new financing on terms aligned with rapid growth and speed, competing copycat retailers as external pressure increasing the cost of delay. 
negotiation result: Stemberg did not accept the initial backers terms, secured new funding from a better aligned investor, and effectively created a credible valuation and momentum for Staples by changing the parties and sequencing rather than arguing over the original terms. 
negotiation strategy: Stemberg used setup moves by declining to fight the original backers purely at the table, expanding his no deal options by targeting a specific investor whose interests matched his growth plan, and sequencing the process to create leverage through speed and competitive urgency; the initial backers used pressure for value capture by demanding a larger stake and tougher terms that Stemberg judged as overly greedy; Trust used fast commitment and price clarity by offering investment on a clean percentage for a clear dollar valuation and saying yes quickly, which reset expectations and made the company’s value feel real in the moment. 
negotiation description: In the early days of Staples, Stemberg needed financing quickly because competitors were expanding rapidly and time lost would be hard to recover.  Rather than spending his effort trying to persuade initial backers who were demanding what he viewed as excessive terms, he treated their stance as a setup problem, not a tactics problem, and changed the game by approaching different funding sources whose interests were more compatible with the deal he wanted. Stemberg found an investor who could move fast and who would price the deal in a straightforward way, creating a credible valuation and injecting momentum at exactly the time it mattered.  The negotiation turned on that reset, the right new party, approached at the right time, produced an agreement that the original table configuration could not, and the speed of acceptance helped convert a fragile startup conversation into a fundable company with a clear value and runway. 


negotiation domain: commercial transaction
negotiation time period: 2006
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: negotiating the sale of a new leak detection technology for gasoline storage tanks, where potential customers refuse to buy because the product would expose them to regulatory, legal, and public relations risk unless the standard applied to everyone.
negotiation parties: LockStore sales engineers representing LockStore as the seller of the detection device, prospective industrial buyers operating gasoline storage tanks representing potential customers deciding whether to purchase, the Environmental Protection Agency as the potential rule-maker whose mandates would determine whether adoption becomes an industry-wide requirement, LockStore suppliers and LockStore competitors as potential coalition partners who could support a regulatory push or licensing approach, selected major tank owners as potential early adopters whose participation could make a coalition credible.
negotiation result: the direct seller to customer negotiation fails because buyers see the device as creating liability rather than value, and the book argues LockStore would need to redesign the negotiation setup by shifting from pure sales bargaining to a broader negotiation aimed at changing the regulatory standard so adoption becomes universal.
negotiation strategy: LockStore initially used a product superiority pitch strategy by focusing on faster better cheaper and assuming technical performance would close the deal, but this created a perspective gap because it did not probe the buyers true interests, which were to avoid becoming the only firm held to a higher compliance standard; the buyers used risk avoidance and first mover resistance by praising the technology while refusing purchase to avoid being singled out for higher remediation costs and possible enforcement or litigation exposure; the recommended strategy in the book is a setup change strategy in which LockStore stops treating the issue as a bilateral sales negotiation and instead builds a multi-party coalition and targets rule-setting, persuading regulators to require the higher standard across the industry and using suppliers, competitors via licensing, and major customers as allies so the compliance burden is shared and the technology becomes the default.
negotiation description: LockStore develops a device that can detect leaks from gas storage tanks with higher performance and lower costs than existing options, and its sales engineers approach prospective industrial buyers expecting the usual commercial conversation about features, price, and installation. The buyers react in a way that surprises LockStore because they agree the device is impressive and the price is attractive, yet they decline to buy, explaining that adopting a superior detection tool would likely trigger regulatory scrutiny, legal exposure, and public relations problems, and could force expensive remediation actions that competitors might avoid if they continue using weaker monitoring methods. In effect, the buyers see the device not as a competitive advantage but as a unilateral burden because it would make them the only ones held to a higher operational standard. With that underlying incentive structure, there is no workable zone of agreement in a simple seller to customer negotiation, because even better pricing or contract tweaks do not solve the core fear of being singled out. The book’s point is that the real path to agreement requires changing the setup, expanding the negotiation beyond the immediate buyers to include parties who shape the rules and the market, especially regulators who could mandate best available monitoring technology for all tank owners. If a higher standard became industry-wide, the same buyers would no longer face the first mover penalty, and LockStore could transform resistance into broad adoption by negotiating upstream on policy, building coalitions, and potentially bringing competitors in through licensing so that the new standard becomes normal rather than risky.


negotiation domain: commercial transaction
negotiation time period: 1996
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: America Online negotiated with competing browser providers to secure a cutting edge web browser for its service, and Microsoft won by shifting the negotiation from technical performance to distribution and customer acquisition.
negotiation parties: America Online represented by senior executives including Jean Villanueva as the internal deal leader deciding which browser partnership best supported subscriber growth; Microsoft represented by top leadership including Bill Gates and the Windows and Internet Explorer business teams offering product integration and distribution; Netscape represented by its commercial team pitching Netscape Navigator as the technically superior and market dominant browser.
negotiation result: Microsoft secured the deal with America Online by providing Internet Explorer for free and agreeing to prominent distribution for America Online software through Windows, while Netscape lost despite technical dominance.
negotiation strategy: Microsoft used issue shifting and value net design by moving the discussion away from browser performance and price toward what America Online valued most, massive low cost distribution and subscriber acquisition leverage, then offered an integrated package that included a free browser, ongoing technical adaptations, and bundling America Online client software with Windows in highly visible placement; America Online used competitive tension and total value evaluation by letting Netscape and Microsoft compete while weighting distribution economics and customer acquisition cost more heavily than technical superiority, effectively treating desktop placement and reach as the core currency of the deal; Netscape used overconfidence and a narrow price framing approach by pushing for a browser for dollars transaction anchored on technical superiority, which failed to address America Online’s larger strategic problem of scalable, low cost growth.
negotiation description: In 1996, America Online urgently needed a strong web browser to meet market expectations as the internet became central to its value proposition, and both Netscape and Microsoft pursued the partnership. Netscape approached the negotiation from a position of strength because Netscape Navigator was widely seen as technically superior and strongly established, so its pitch emphasized a straightforward transaction in which America Online would pay for access to the better browser. Microsoft approached from a weaker technical position because Internet Explorer was viewed as inferior at the time, so Microsoft avoided competing head to head on features and instead redefined what the negotiation was really about for America Online, namely customer acquisition reach, distribution power, and strategic positioning against Microsoft’s broader platform influence. Microsoft then offered a package that made Internet Explorer effectively free for America Online and promised ongoing technical improvements, while also offering distribution that Netscape could not match, bundling America Online client software with Windows and giving it premium desktop placement that could reach tens of millions of users per year at minimal marginal cost. For America Online, the distribution and subscriber growth effects outweighed the technical gap, because the deal reduced its acquisition costs relative to its prior mass marketing approach and strengthened its ability to scale quickly. The negotiation concluded with Microsoft winning the partnership by reshaping the issues, expanding the value on the table beyond the browser itself, and trading away medium term positioning of its own online service ambitions to prioritize winning the browser war through America Online.


negotiation domain: conflict resolution and repair
negotiation time period: 1990s
negotiation location: United States
negotiation topic: negotiating a settlement to end a legal stalemate over a proposed dam by trading dam size, construction timing, water flow guarantees, habitat protections, and funding mechanisms that meet each side’s core interests.
negotiation parties: regional power company project team representing the developer seeking new generating capacity and a greener public image, coalition of local farmers and landowners representing downstream water users concerned about reduced water flow and farm impacts, coalition of environmental advocates representing habitat protection priorities focused on downstream conditions for the endangered whooping crane, government permitting and judicial bodies as the outside decision channel created by the ongoing legal dispute and approvals process.
negotiation result: the parties move from positional deadlock into a jointly designed package that permits a smaller dam on a faster timeline with enforceable water flow and habitat commitments plus a trust fund for habitat enhancement elsewhere.
negotiation strategy: the power company shifts from a single project proposal to a package trade strategy by accepting a smaller project and adding credible commitments and funding that address environmental and agricultural concerns while preserving its capacity and reputational objectives; the farmers shift from blanket opposition to interest-protection bargaining by prioritizing enforceable downstream water flow guarantees and operational protections rather than only fighting the project; the environmental advocates shift from pure blocking to value-creating conditional support by specifying concrete downstream habitat protections and accepting tradeoffs when protections are strengthened and extended through a dedicated trust fund; the overall negotiation uses deal design and issue unbundling by separating what looked like one fight into multiple negotiable elements so each side can win on what it values most at lower cost to the others.
negotiation description: A power company proposes building a dam, and a coalition of farmers and a coalition of environmental advocates oppose it, producing a long stalemate that becomes increasingly costly as the dispute moves through approvals and litigation. At first, the conflict looks like irreconcilable positions, build the dam versus stop the dam, but closer mapping of underlying interests shows distinct concerns: the farmers fear reduced water flow below the dam that could harm their operations, the environmental side focuses on the downstream habitat needs tied to the endangered whooping crane, and the power company needs additional generating capacity and also wants to improve its environmental image. Once the parties treat the problem as a design challenge rather than a yes or no fight, they begin assembling a package that trades across issues: the company accepts a smaller dam and agrees to a fast track approach to reduce prolonged uncertainty, while the farmers and environmental advocates gain enforceable water flow guarantees and downstream habitat protections that directly address their core risks. To extend environmental value beyond the immediate site and make commitments durable, the package includes a trust fund intended to enhance whooping crane habitats elsewhere. By shifting from positional arguments to a multi-part agreement with clear commitments, the negotiation transforms a legal impasse into a structured settlement that each side can justify as better than continuing the fight.
