functions of family: a family may provide many important functions. Biological -satisfying sexual desires, having children and ensuring the continuation of generation. Psychological- providing a loving environment. Economic: providing economic support. Protective: protecting and offering security. Educational: parenting and educating children. Values: providing value systems including religion, faith etc.. Leisure: providing comfort, rest, fun such as family holidays etc.. Prestige: providing social status as family being the smallest building block of society. Socialization: providing an environment for learning  how to integrate into society. However, practical limitations and challenges can affect a family’s ability to provide the above functions, such as socio-economic conditions, family structure, health, and external stressors etc. Families with limited financial resources may struggle to provide for basic needs, healthcare, and education. Economic constraints can also impact their ability to offer emotional stability and recreational activities. Single parents may face challenges in fulfilling all functions due to the increased burden of managing both parenting and economic responsibilities alone. Families formed through remarriage may encounter difficulties in integrating members and providing consistent parenting and emotional support. Different cultures have varying expectations and norms regarding family roles and functions. Cultural practices can influence how families fulfill these functions. The availability of social services, community support, and extended family involvement can impact a family’s ability to provide for all its functions. Families dealing with health issues, such as chronic illness or mental health conditions, may find it challenging to meet all their members' needs effectively. Families experiencing high levels of conflict, dysfunction, or instability may struggle to provide emotional support, effective socialization, and other key functions. Poor communication can affect the ability of families to provide guidance, resolve conflicts, and offer emotional support. Access to quality education and healthcare can vary widely, affecting a family’s ability to support the educational and health needs of its members. During times of economic downturns or crises, families may face increased stress and difficulty in fulfilling their functions effectively. Events like natural disasters or emergencies can disrupt family functioning and impact their ability to provide for basic needs and emotional support.

family structure/nuclear family: two parents and any number of children living together, often considered the traditional family unit. Parents can provide more focused attention and resources to their children without the distraction of extended family members. The nuclear family often enjoys more privacy and personal space compared to extended families. However, it may lack the additional support and resources available in extended family structures, such as help with childcare or caregiving for elderly relatives.

family structure/single parent family: one parent and any number of children living together; can be matrifocal or patrifocal. Single parents may face unique challenges and responsibilities, including balancing work and childcare, and often rely on external support systems.

family structure/extended family: a family of spouse and children plus other relatives by blood or marriage, such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins etc.. Extended family members often live together or maintain close relationships and provide additional support and resources. Extended family members often provide additional emotional support and a sense of belonging. They can assist with childcare, household tasks, and caregiving, making daily life easier. Resources like income and property can be pooled together, helping to alleviate financial burdens. Household duties and responsibilities can be divided among more people, reducing the workload on individual family members. Children and adults benefit from interacting with a broader range of family members, which can enhance social skills and emotional development. Extended families often maintain and pass down cultural traditions, stories, and values. Extended families can offer stability and support during times of family crises, such as illness or financial difficulties. Grandparents and other relatives can provide reliable childcare, which can be especially beneficial for working parents. Different family members bring various perspectives, experiences, and skills, which can contribute to more well-rounded decision-making and problem-solving. On the other hand, an increased number of family members can lead to more disagreements and conflicts, particularly over family roles, responsibilities, and resources. Shared living spaces can result in reduced privacy and personal space, which can strain relationships. The presence of multiple generations and family branches can create confusion about roles and authority, leading to conflicts. Relying heavily on extended family members for support can sometimes create dependency or unrealistic expectations. While resources are pooled, the financial responsibility for supporting multiple family members can also be burdensome. Shared assets can lead to disputes over inheritance and property. Managing schedules, coordinating activities, and planning family events can become complex with a larger group. If living together, space constraints and logistical issues can arise, affecting family harmony. Different generations may have varying values, expectations, and lifestyles, which can lead to misunderstandings and disagreements. Variations in parenting approaches among family members can create confusion and inconsistency for children. Balancing the advantages and disadvantages often requires effective communication, clear role definitions, and a willingness to manage and resolve conflicts constructively.

Communal families often emphasize shared living and collective support, which can enhance social and economic stability.

Arranged marriages involve families that support the union, and the couple is usually integrated into both families, which can lead to a more extended support system and a sense of belonging. Families often consider shared cultural, social, and economic values and the compatibility of the couple’s backgrounds, traditions, and future aspirations when arranging marriages, which can help in aligning goals and expectations. Individuals may experience less pressure to date and find a partner on their own, as families handle the matchmaking process. The arranged marriage process often involves family guidance, which can provide structure and support during the selection process. It often emphasizes long-term commitment and stability. In some cultures, arranged marriages are seen as a respected tradition. Family involvement can provide mechanisms for resolving conflicts and ensuring that issues are addressed with broader support. However, individuals may have less control over their choice of spouse. There may be pressure to accept a match even if personal preferences or romantic inclinations are not aligned. Couples usually don’t have enough time or opportunities to interact with each other sufficiently before marriage, and differences in personal values, interests, and lifestyles may surface after marriage, causing friction. Adjusting to a spouse chosen by family rather than personal choice can be emotionally challenging, requiring time and effort to build a strong relationship.

parenting: directly observable specific behaviors that parents use to socialize their children. There are two dimensions. Parent Support - pertains to the affective nature of the parent-child relationship, indicated by showing involvement, acceptance, emotional availability, warmth, and responsiveness. Support has been related to positive development outcomes in children. Parent Control - behavior control: control, manage, regulate child behavior, either through enforcing demands and rules, disciplinary strategies, control of rewards and punishment, or through supervisory functions. An appropriate amount of behavioral control has been considered to positively affect child development, whereas insufficient or excessive behavioral control e.g., parental physical punishment has been commonly associated with negative child developmental outcomes, such as deviant behavior, misconduct, depression and anxious affect; psychological control: intrusively manipulate a child’s thoughts, emotions and feelings.

joint impact of coexisting of paternal and maternal parenting styles: referring to the different approaches and philosophies that mothers and fathers may bring to parenting, which can have a significant impact on the overall family dynamic, child development, and the effectiveness of parenting strategies. Parents can learn from each other’s styles and adapt their approaches over time, leading to personal growth and improved parenting strategies. Coexisting styles can encourage parents to be more flexible and responsive to their child's changing needs and developmental stages.The joint impact depends on how well these styles complement or conflict with each other, as well as the adaptability of both parents. Different parenting styles can provide a balanced approach to child-rearing, offering children diverse perspectives and experiences. For example, a father’s more authoritative style and a mother’s more nurturing approach can complement each other, providing a well-rounded upbringing. Children can benefit from exposure to different problem-solving strategies, emotional responses, and disciplinary methods, helping them develop adaptability and resilience. When both parents have complementary styles that align on core values and rules, it creates a stable and consistent environment. This consistency is crucial for children’s understanding of expectations and boundaries. Differing parenting styles can lead to conflicts between parents, which might affect their relationship and impact their effectiveness as a team. For instance, if one parent is more permissive while the other is more strict, it can create tension and inconsistency in discipline. Inconsistent messages from parents regarding rules, expectations, or emotional support can confuse children and impact their behavior and emotional well-being. The coexistence of different parenting styles can also impact sibling dynamics, as children may experience varying degrees of leniency or strictness depending on which parent is involved. Parents with conflicting styles need to find ways to align their approaches or manage inconsistencies to avoid confusing or undermining each other’s authority. Successful parenting in such situations involves open communication, finding common ground, and adapting strategies to provide a stable and supportive environment for children.
